## APRHODITE WORKSHOP 
## AdaPtive beHavioRal mODels of robotic systems based on brain-inspired AI cogniTivE architectures.
This workshop is organized in conjunction with IEEE RO-MAN ‘20 - The 29th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication. The cooperation between humans and robots is becoming increasingly important in our society. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of models that can enhance the interaction between humans and robots. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different scientific community in order to promote cooperation and discussion with the idea that a multidisciplinary context is ideal for fostering this research topic.

- **Workshop date:** August 31, 2020
- **Workshop location:** Royal Continental Hotel, Naples, Italy
