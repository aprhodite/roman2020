# APRHODITE WORKSHOP 
## AdaPtive beHavioRal mODels of robotic systems based on brain-inspired AI cogniTivE architectures.
This workshop is organized in conjunction with IEEE RO-MAN ‘20 - The 29th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication. The cooperation between humans and robots is becoming increasingly important in our society. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of models that can enhance the interaction between humans and robots. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different scientific community in order to promote cooperation and discussion with the idea that a multidisciplinary context is ideal for fostering this research topic.

- **Workshop date:** August 31, 2020
- **Workshop location:** Royal Continental Hotel, Naples, Italy

### Paper Pubblication
We would like to inform you that this workshop is linked to a **Special Issue** of the **International Journal of Social Robotics**, titled [Behavioral model for robot based on brain-inspired AI cognitive architecture](https://www.springer.com/journal/12369/updates/17900528).
This special issue is now open for submission.  
Authors of a manuscript accepted (including those with minor revisions) for publication in the Special Issue before the 25/08/2020 will be given the opportunity to present at the workshop.
Vice versa, authors of best contributions accepted at the workshop will be invited to submit a revised and substantially extended versions of selected papers to the special issue.
Manuscripts can be submitted to the special issue at any time. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript.
